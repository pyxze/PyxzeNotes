Please edit your Apache configuration file, and add these lines:

   LoadModule passenger_module /usr/local/share/gems/gems/passenger-3.0.18/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
   PassengerRoot /usr/local/share/gems/gems/passenger-3.0.18

After you restart Apache, you are ready to deploy any number of Ruby on Rails
applications on Apache, without any further Ruby on Rails-specific
configuration!

Press ENTER to continue.


--------------------------------------------
Deploying a Ruby on Rails application: an example

Suppose you have a Rails application in /somewhere. Add a virtual host to your
Apache configuration file and set its DocumentRoot to /somewhere/public:

   <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName www.yourhost.com
      # !!! Be sure to point DocumentRoot to 'public'!
      DocumentRoot /somewhere/public    
      <Directory /somewhere/public>
         # This relaxes Apache security settings.
         AllowOverride all
         # MultiViews must be turned off.
         Options -MultiViews
      </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>
