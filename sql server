"As SQL Server is a bad default DBMS for a Symfony app, especially on Unix servers, you should be interested by using multiple database connection with Symfony and Doctrine."

"As you can see it's such a pain to support MS SQL Server in Doctrine and you should avoid to use it as much as possible in your PHP projects."

Here is how paging was handled before SQL Server 2012 using a common table expression (CTE) and ROW_NUMBER():

WITH Paging_CTE AS
(
SELECT
TransactionID
, ProductID
, TransactionDate
, Quantity
, ActualCost
, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY TransactionDate DESC) AS RowNumber
FROM
Production.TransactionHistory
)
SELECT
TransactionID
, ProductID
, TransactionDate
, Quantity
, ActualCost
FROM
Paging_CTE
WHERE RowNumber > 0 AND RowNumber <= 20

SQL Server 2012 introduced OFFSET and FETCH which now allows us to write the paging request as such:

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.Pagination_Test_1 -- ORDER BY CustomerID
  @PageNumber INT = 1,
  @PageSize   INT = 100
AS
BEGIN
  SET NOCOUNT ON;

  SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName,
      EMail, Active, Created, Updated
    FROM dbo.Customers_I
    ORDER BY CustomerID
    OFFSET @PageSize * (@PageNumber - 1) ROWS
    FETCH NEXT @PageSize ROWS ONLY OPTION (RECOMPILE);
END
GO
